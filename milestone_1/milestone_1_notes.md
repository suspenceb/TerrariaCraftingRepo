## What needs to get done
Describe the purpose and requirements of the project, by:
- Create a Project definition statement (<30 words)
- Identify stakeholders
    - Ask them what they want from this system
- Create High Level requirements, including:
    - Functionality
    - Non-functional, system-design stuff: (don't need to hit every one of these)
        - Security
        - Portability
        - Maintainability
        - Reliability
        - Performance
        - Availability
        - Flexibility
        - Usabilty (e.g. responsive design on mobile and desktop?)
        - Scalability (e.g. 3000 concurrent users)
- Create a lo-fi prototype (of major front-end interface pages)

(Each of these things will be broken into their own section, below)
